# Bots

This repo is for online shopping tools.

I just revised my old Nike auto-add-to-cart Javascript for the popular Yayoi Kusama the Infinity Mirrors show at Hirshhorn Museum in Washington D.C. I also put the Nike bot here too, just for your own convenience.

I didn't get a loading page for the tickets, I will try to save one next week so I can further automate the process.

Currently the ISSUE is that the js script cannot get the default quantity (4) to proceed, I assume it's because the element name "best_available=best_available" is not a match, I will doube check next week.

Any tech savvy please HELP! 

Switch to the corresponding branches to download the file.

Cheers.
